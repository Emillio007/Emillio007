### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emil, and I am a Master's student in Quantum Information Science, based in Copenhagen, DK. 

Education and work:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
-    A classification ML-algorithm for use in the public educational sector. The algorithm is intended for institutions to help identify schools alike.
-    A simulation tool for investigating the collective excitation behaviour in arbitrary atomic arrays. The package is intended for use in research.
-    CQ - A Classical-Quantum compiler designed to partially evaluate all classical computation and output an optimized flat program-stack for a QPU (based on the work of James: github.com/jamesavery).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Quantum Information Science with specialization in physical implementations of quantum information processing. I have a Bachelor's degree in Quantum Physics.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything quantumy. I am always interested in chatting. My primary programming language is Python.
