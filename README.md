### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emil, and I am a Master's student in Quantum Information Science, based in Copenhagen, DK. 

Education and work:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a simulation tool for investigating the collective excitation behaviour in atom arrays. The package is intended for use in research.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m finishing up my thesis in Quantum Information Science with specialization in theoretical physics of quantum information processing. I have a Bachelor's degree in Quantum Physics.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything quantumy. I am always interested in chatting. My primary programming language is Python.
